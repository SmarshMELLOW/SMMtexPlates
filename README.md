<h1>Overview</h1>

<p>The SMMtexPlates repository is a resource of latex templates for creating pretty tex documents. Most latex documents don't need a lot of formatting and, if I want to add some, I will just call the mypaperstyle.sty file. I will update this repository with additional document templates if I feel that the template that I am using is complicated enough or has enough macros to warrant possibly being useful for someone else. </p>

<h2>Academic Papers</h2>

<p>Used in conjunction, template Paper Plate and template mypaperstyle.sty.tex will create an academic paper complete with:</p>

<ol>
<li>Cover page and abstract</li>
<li>Sections</li>
<li>Bibliography and appendicies</li>
</ol>

<p>Before using these templates you will need to change the name of the style file to mypaperstyle.sty and be sure to save it in the same folder as your academic type paper. </p>

<p>This template was designed to be used in conjunction with the import package, but that is not necessary. </p>

<h2>Newsletters</h2>

<p>The Smarsh Quarterly template is the template for the newsletter that I write. It is designed to be a two page newsletter that contains three images which need to be saved as jpeg files. Adjust it to match your style and please include me on your mailing list!</p>
